# Payday 2 Big Oil Solver

This project was made for the video game Payday 2.  
It helps the users solve the notorious puzzle at the second day of the Big Oil heist.  
To start, you need to find the clues in-game. For example, if you find the clue "5783", you can mark the checkbox next to "5783" in the webpage. That way, all the engines that are not using the pressure "5783" will be filtered out.  
The webpage also helps with showing the basement map, and how to clues look like in-game.  
Make sure to read the Q&A at the end of the webpage.
