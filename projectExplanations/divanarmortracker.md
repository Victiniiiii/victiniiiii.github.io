# Divan Armor Tracker

This is a small helper project for the video game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It uses both the official Hypixel Skyblock API, and the COFLNET API (because it doesn't require an API key but is much slower than the official API).  
The webpage shows the current auctioning prices of all the armor pieces, and how much forging it manually would cost, adding taxes on top of the calculation to show a final profit value.
