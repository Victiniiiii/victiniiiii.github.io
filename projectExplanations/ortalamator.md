This is a personal project i made, to easily calculate my grades.  
Being one of my first JavaScript projects, coding this helped me improve my skills immensely.  
It also has two more tabs, one to calculate the final exam grade needed for every grade letter, and another one to answer frequently asked questions.  
In the settings of the main page of the modal, the user is able to copy all their grades from the school website, and just paste it here. The code uses Regex to automatically detect lessons and their grades, and automatically change the lesson grades in app.  
This webpage also has a PWA (Progressive Web App), for easier access from mobile devices.
