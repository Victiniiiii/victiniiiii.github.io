# Inferno Minion Calculator

This is a project made for the video game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It contains all the needed information about the Inferno Minions.  
Firstly, the user is able to calculate how much coins are their minions making, by customising the settings in the first section. It fetches the official Hypixel Skyblock API to get all the item prices.  
In the second section, all the items that are being crafted with inferno minion drops are shown, along with their profits after selling.  
The third section shows us the costs to upgrade an inferno minion. It includes total costs and upgrading costs.  
Below it we have a small part showing the rare drops from the inferno minions, and their dropping chance percentages.  
Finally, there is a Q&A part to answer the unanswered questions about the inferno minions.
