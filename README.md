## Bazaar Buy Npc Sell Flips

This project is created for the game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It fetches the official API, then shows the users how profitable buying each item and selling it to NPCs is.  
Doesn't use all the items, but these ones are the best ones I could find.  
You can access the bazaar settings menu, and switch any item between sell order and insta-sell options.  
If you want items added here, you can create a pull request, or tell me and I will try to create time to include them myself.

## Payday 2 Big Oil Solver

This project was made for the video game Payday 2.  
It helps the users solve the notorious puzzle at the second day of the Big Oil heist.  
To start, you need to find some clues in-game. For example, if you find the clue "5783", you can mark the checkbox next to "5783" in the webpage. That way, all the engines that are not using the pressure "5783" will be filtered out.  
The webpage also helps with showing the basement map, and how the clues look like in-game.  
Make sure to read the Q&A at the end of the webpage.  

## Compost Profit Calculator

This project was made for the video game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It helps the users by automatically calculating their composter profits according to their upgrade inputs and the live Hypixel Skyblock API.  
The app also uses the API to show the current best fuels and the current costs to do all the upgrades of the composter.  

## Divan Armor Tracker

This is a small helper project for the video game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It uses both the official Hypixel Skyblock API, and the COFLNET API (because it doesn't require an API key but is much slower than the official API).  
The webpage shows the current auctioning prices of all the armor pieces, and how much forging it manually would cost, adding taxes on top of the calculation to show a final profit value.  

## Effective HP Calculator

This is a very small project for the video game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It is meant for calculating how much effective HP you would have with the input amounts of HP and defense.  
This way the players can easily prioritize HP or defense, whichever one gives them the most effective HP.  
Fun fact: This project literally took 10 minutes to code entirely.

## Forging Perfect Gemstone Calculator

This is a small project for the video game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It aims providing the users with all the gemstone forge profits, so it is easier to choose between the options.  
The webpage uses the official Hypixel Skyblock API to fetch the Flawless and Perfect Gemstone prices.  
The reason the project has the file shortcut of "flaskforge" is, the project was first coded in Python and Flask. Now, the project fully uses JavaScript.  

## Fortune vs Pristine Calculator

This is a very small project for the video game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It helps the users to whether prioritize fortune or pristine to gain more coins per hour.  
Not much to say about this one.  

## Inferno Minion Calculator

This is a project made for the video game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It contains all the needed information about the Inferno Minions.  
Firstly, the user is able to calculate how much coins their minions are making, by customising the settings in the first section. It fetches the official Hypixel Skyblock API to get all the item prices.  
In the second section, all the items that are being crafted with inferno minion drops are shown, along with their profits after selling.  
The third section shows us the costs to upgrade an inferno minion. It includes total costs and upgrading costs.  
Below that is a small part showing the rare drops from the inferno minions, and their dropping chance percentages.  
Finally, there is a Q&A part to answer the unanswered questions about the inferno minions.  

## IzmirGuessr

This is a web-based game, inspired from the game GeoGuessr, but coded entirely from scratch.  
The main difference is, instead of guessing the random jungles or the deserts of the world, this game is aimed to have the neighborhoods where we grew up, making the locations truly guessable, also creating a factor of nostalgia.  
The districts are also toggleable, so you can limit the play area to your five most favorite districts, or even one.  
It uses the free version of the Google Maps API, to create street view in the webpage. The user then needs to guess where they are based on their surroundings, and put their guess at the minimap bottom right of the screen. The points are calculated according to how close the guess was.  
The game also uses Firebase, for both authentication and storage, to create the public leaderboards, personal statistics and match history.  

## NPC Buy Bazaar Sell Flips

This is a project made for the video game Hypixel Skyblock.  
It aims to show the items that can be purchased by NPCs to be later sold at the Bazaar for a profit.  
It is especially good for the players in the early game.  

## Ortalamat√∂r

This is a personal project I made, to easily calculate my grades.  
Being one of my first JavaScript projects, coding this helped me improve my skills immensely.  
It also has two more tabs, one to calculate the final exam grade needed for every letter grade, and another one to answer frequently asked questions.  
In the settings tab of the main modal page, the user is able to copy all their grades from the school website, and just paste it here. The code uses Regex to automatically detect lessons and their grades, and automatically change the lesson grades in the app.  
This webpage also has a PWA (Progressive Web App) for easier access from mobile devices.

## Password Generator

This is a small project to generate a fully secure custom password.  
The password components are customizable, and the output can be easily copied using the button below.
